A final tidy up of the application documentation is currently under way, along with some videos. I would like to give people a quick 1 minute overview as to the feature set of this tool, along with why I built it. I'm also going to create a video tutorial to get people up and running quickly.

The idea is that people can quickly get an idea as to what this application does, and also, how to quickly get productive with it.

I'll also be making some bug fixes to ensure the initial setup is straight forward. Keep in mind the application is still in a somewhat alpha state.
