The HaaS tool is now avaiable and ready to use for anyone interested. My next few weeks will involve working on tidying up what I have already finished, to make the tool ideally easy to run and install. Work is also happening on the documentation site. Mostly polish at this point, before getting back into adding features that I'm after.
